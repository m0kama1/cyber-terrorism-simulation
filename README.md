# Cyber Terrorism Crisis Simulator

Decision-based educational simulation for training security and intelligence professionals on managing cyber-terrorism crises through strategic choices and trade-offs.

> **Focus:** governance, coordination, public communication, and political trade-offs  
> **Not focus:** technical attack steps or operational guidance

---

## Overview

**Cyber Terrorism Crisis Simulator** is a lightweight web-based simulation (hosted via GitHub Pages) that places the learner in the role of a **national cyber crisis management cell**.

Learners make time-pressured decisions across multiple phases of a crisis and observe how choices impact key outcome indicators such as:
- Security control
- Public trust
- Continuity of critical services
- Domestic & international pressure

The simulator is designed for:
- Classroom instruction
- Executive training
- Scenario-based discussions
- AI-augmented learning (future roadmap)

---

## Current Scenario (MVP)

### Scenario 01: Critical Disruption + Disinformation
A partial disruption affects critical services while a coordinated disinformation wave spreads conflicting narratives about a “cyber-terrorist attack.”  
The learner must manage the crisis under uncertainty, balancing transparency, control, and legitimacy.

---

## How it Works

The simulation is **decision-centric**:
1. Read the situation brief for the current phase
2. Choose one of the available decisions
3. Review the outcome explanation
4. Proceed to the next phase

No technical exploit details are included.

## Live Demo (GitHub Pages)

After GitHub Pages is enabled, the simulator will be available at:

`https://m0kama1.github.io/cyber-terrorism-simulation/`

> If the link is not active yet, wait for the Pages build to finish under **Actions**.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add KPI dashboard (4 indicators)
- [ ] Add Scenario 01 phases (3 phases + final report)
- [ ] Add additional scenarios:
  - Cyber extortion & coercion
  - Crisis during elections / national events
  - State-linked attribution ambiguity
  - Institutional coordination conflict
- [ ] Add “Instructor Notes” (training objectives per decision)
- [ ] Generate a final after-action report (AAR) for learners

## About the Author

This project is developed by **Mohamed Kamal**, a cybersecurity and cybercrime investigations specialist with a focus on **cyber terrorism, national security, and strategic decision-making**.

The simulator reflects practical experience in:
- Cybercrime and cyber-terrorism analysis
- Security-oriented research and training
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- AI-augmented educational tools

The goal is to bridge the gap between **technical cyber incidents** and their **strategic, political, and security implications**.
